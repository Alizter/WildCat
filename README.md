TODO:

Develop a wildcat library dependent on the hott library without needing to disturb upstream development.

We want to consider:

 * Ease of use
 * Efficiency of typeclass search
 * Elaboration by coq
 * Flexivility of constructions
 * Example: Definitionally involutive op
 * Having more cells, coinductive/globular appraoch or specified
 * Various levels of coherence
